# odin-landing-page

Initially, I started by trying to make the whole html skeleton before using flexbox to position sections of the page. That got way too confusing though. So I regrouped and broke each section and used the inspect tool in the browser to see what was happening. 

Learned a ton about how to preview and fix html and CSS with the inspect tool. Was able to preview what changes edits in html or css would have on the actual page before commiting it to the working file. 

Also learned a lot about how to answer my own questions by seeing what other people have asked previously (such as why does the background-color not span the entire page).

All in all, I had a great time applying what I have learned so far into creating a webpage. 
Picking out different color palettes and fonts was also a great time. 

Still not very comfortable with commit messages on how and when to push to github. Will need to study more about it and practice.
